#Create a random password with the following requirements:

  * Length: 18 default value
  * To change the length, use the following command:
    - export TF_VAR_length=20 in the shell changing the lenght will regenerate the password
### Can also be done using the following command: terraform apply -var 'length=20' -auto-approve
  * Alphanumeric characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9
  * Special characters: !#$%&*()-_=+[]{}<>:?
  * Output the password as a sensitive output
### Terraform command sequence:
`terraform init
`terraform apply
`terraform output espassword

Every run will generate a new password and store it in the Azure storage account as part of the state. The storage accunt have versioning enabled, so you can always revert to a previous version of the password if needed.
