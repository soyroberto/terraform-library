# Create a Spotify Playlist with Terraform

This repo is a companion repo to the [Create a Spotify Playlist with Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/community-providers/spotify-playlist) tutorial.
It contains Terraform configuration you can use to learn how to create a playlist on Spotify.

#### It's more of a learning code ####
