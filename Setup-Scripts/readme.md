# Setup scripts for using this Repo

## Windows

Using the two PowerShell scripts you can install Chocolatey and then the required apps for this repo.

 - [TerraformApps.ps1](https://github.com/jakewalsh90/Terraform-Azure/blob/main/Setup-Scripts/TerraformApps.ps1) - Installs the Apps needed to work with Terraform. 
 - [AllApps.ps1](https://github.com/jakewalsh90/Terraform-Azure/blob/main/Setup-Scripts/AllApps.ps1) - Installs all the Apps I use on my Windows machine for working with Terraform, Packer, GitHub, and more. 

## Mac OSX

I would recommend using Brew to install the required applications - see here: https://formulae.brew.sh/
